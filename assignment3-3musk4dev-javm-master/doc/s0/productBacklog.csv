User Story 1.2,Cell constructor,Marko,5,3,Developer,optimization of cells to be done automatically with less constructor calls,"I don't need to collect as many arguments and create multiple instances for one cell; moreover, increasing code reusability with a high degree of optimizability","Create a cell builder class that takes in the bare minimum parameters (coordinates and piece type), then to automatically build the cell"
User Story 1.3,Override save file,Aedas,4,1,User,Option to override the original board if we want to save a board with the same name,I don't have to think of a new name everytime I want to save a board,"Rewrite the board txt file if there is one (except for Starter.txt, in that case it throws an exception) "
User Story 1.4,Add scenes,Aedas,1,5,User,There to be a game over screen and a options screen,I can customise the game/adjust the colors,"Create an abstract scene implementation with concrete scenes, then add color attributes to View class, and modify the code that sets the color of game objects accordingly."
User Story 1.5,Make the game resizable ,Aedas,2,7,User,The game window to be resizable ,I can run the game in monitors of different resolutions,Use relative positioning instead of absolute positioning in all game Objects. Add relative screen coordinates to every object to be shown on screen
User Story 1.6,Board customizer,Marko,6,5,User,To be able to make new boards within the game itself,I don't need to write up properly formatted text files for different board scenarios,"Create a new view that allows you to click into each cell of the 5x5 grid, then the user is allowed to change the piece type of each of the cells on the board. Note that the 3 musketeers cannot be in the same row. The board is then converted into a text file that stores piece location data as well as the current turn."
