What are some good practices that helped you during this sprint
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Documentation that Aedas provided regarding the resizability of the components of the view; it gave us a better sense of developers to understand what he has specifically implemented when trying to build our own GUI implementations - be it the turn visualizer, the label messages, the saving function as well as the board customizer.

  Javadocs and comments to inform each other the implementation details and the functionality of various methods. This allowed for less communication time and debugging time; the input and output was strictly documented well for others who may use the code to understand.

What are some new practices that you might want to employ during your next project? 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spreading out tasks that do not have lots of blockages, for instance, in this project, the GUI was the main hindrance factor in further progression of our team. Since Aedas implemented the base GUI framework for the other members, it was significantly delaying the entire process. It would be better to lay out user stories that do not impose such a large blockade in our next projects.

What are (if any) harmful practices that hurt the progression of this sprint?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nothing much, aside from creating too many git branches and not merging each one with caution. 

What was your best/worst experience during sprint 2?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dealing with git branches and merging with the master branch. It caused a lot of confusion at start, starting from the conflicts of code that had to be resolved manually with git. At one point, Aedas nearly lost hours of his progression due to merging conflicts - and even then some of the commits were lost to void due to the complications of git merging. Our standups and other documentations were gone and had to be redone.
